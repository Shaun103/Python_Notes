WHEN TO USE ARRAY METHODS: 

( Ask yourself....'what do you actually want from the method')


TO MUTATE THE ORIGINAL ARRAY:
	add to original: 
		.push	 
		.unshift

	remove from original:
		.pop
		.shift
		.splice

	others:
		.reverse
		.sort
		.fill

A NEW ARRAY: 
	computed from original: 
		.map

	filtered using condition
		.filter

	portion of original 
		.slice

	adding original to other 
		.concat

	flattening the original
		.flat
		.flatMap


A ARRAY INDEX:
	Based on value:
		.indexOf
	
	based on test condition:
		(search for an element in the array based on a test condition)
		.findIndex
	
AN ARRAY ELEMENT: 
	based on test condition: 
		(need the array element itself)
		.find

KNOW IF ARRAY INCLUDES: 
	based on value: 
	(test if an array has a single value)
		.includes 
	
	based on test condition: 
		.some
		.every

A NEW STRING: 
	a new string: 
	(based on separator string)
		.join

TO TRANSFORM TO VALUE: 
	based on accumulator:
	(Boil down array to single value
	of any type: number, string, boolean, 
	or even new array or object)	
		.reduce


TO JUST LOOP ARRAY: 
	based on callback:
	(does not create a new array 
	just loops over it)
		.forEach
